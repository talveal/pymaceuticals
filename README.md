# pymaceuticals

Hello everyone,
Please note that I worked with Mabeyda, Miggy, Karishma, and Euri on this assignment. 

Pymaceuticals Analysis:
- Capomulin and ramicane seemed to be the most effective treatments in treating the tumors.
- As mouse weight goes up, average tumor volume goes up. 
- Through my own analysis, I found that many mice treated with capomulin reached their lowest tumor size after 25-45 of treatment. I'm curious to see how much more the tumors could have gone down if the treatment period had been extended.
